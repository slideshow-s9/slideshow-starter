# Slide Show Quick Starter Kit

Write your own talks in plain text (with Markdown).

## What's included?

- A first sample talk (see [`sample1.text`](sample1.text)) 
- A second sample talk (see [`sample2.text`](sample2.text)) incl. some macros/helpers e.g. `left`, `right`, `step`, `google_analytics` etc.


## Build Instructions

Use the Slide Show (S9) command line tool to build
a web page (e.g. `sample1.html` or `sample2.html`)
that is an all-in-one-page handout and a live slide show all at once.

```
$ slideshow build sample1.text

=> Preparing slideshow 'sample1.html'...
=> Done.
```

That's it. Open up your slide show `sample1.html` or `sample2.html` in your browser
(Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge and others) and hit F11 to switch into full screen projection
and hit the space bar or the right arrow, down arrow or page down key to flip through your slides.
